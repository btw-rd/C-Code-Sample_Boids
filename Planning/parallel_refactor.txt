the boid averaging operations cannot be parallelized easily, parallelize everything else so that we can do the averaging part cleanly, but avoid nests

---
for each boid, establish a list of all points in range
1 2 3 4 5 6
  2 3 4 5 6
    3 4 5 6

for each index i 
{
    KERNEL
    for each index j > i
    {
        distance(i, j)
        if distance < range
        {
            pairs[i].append(j)
            pairs[j].append(i)
        }
    }
}

KERNEL
for each entry in pairs
{
    run boid update across its pairs collection
}
